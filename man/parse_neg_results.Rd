\usage{
parse_neg_results(raw, rule, IonMode)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw}{a data frame with variables as columns.  Should contain all output columns from XCMS and CAMERA, additional columns from IHL.search and a Minfrac column.  The last columns must be the CAMERA columns "isotopes","adduct","pcgroup" in that order.}

\item{rule}{a data frame containing the rule list used by CAMERA to annotate ion adducts and fragments.  Must contain the columns "name","nmol","charge","massdiff","oidscore","quasi","ips".}

\item{IonMode}{a character string defining the ionization mode.  Must be "Negative"}
}
\value{
data frame parsed version of the original data frame with additional columns "mono_mass","metabolite_group","monoisotopic_flg","adduct_flg","isotope_flg","ambiguity_flg","Selection_flg"
}
\description{
Parses the CAMERA results using well-defined rules to eliminate conflicting annotations.
